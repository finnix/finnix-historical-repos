# To have GRUB2 boot a Finnix ISO, uncomment the following line and 
# specify the location.  This can either be a single ISO, or a 
# directory containing Finnix ISOs.
#
# Note that there are several restrictions, both from GRUB2 and Finnix, 
# regarding where the ISO may be booted from (type of partition, 
# filesystem, etc).  Please see the package's README.Debian file for 
# details.
