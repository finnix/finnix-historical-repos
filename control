Description: Hardware-generated random data using the truerand algorithm
 twuewand is software that creates hardware-generated random data.  It
 accomplishes this by exploiting the fact that the CPU clock and the RTC
 (real-time clock) are physically separate, and that time and work are
 not linked.
