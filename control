Description: Brute-force hashes which match a desired hex string
 vanityhash is a tool that can discover data to be added to the end of 
 a file to produce a desired hex hash fragment. It searches a message 
 space and runs a hashing algorithm against the original data plus the 
 appended data to determine if the desired hash fragment is present. 
 vanityhash can run multiple parallel workers to effectively make use 
 of multiple processors/cores/threads, and supports multiple hash 
  digest types (MD5, SHA1, SHA256, etc).
